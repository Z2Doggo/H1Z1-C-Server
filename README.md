# An 'H1Z1: King of the Kill' server made in the C programming language!

## Current Status
- [x] Compile for use, send and receive packets
- [x] Handle Client connection request (you'll still be on the loading screen but the `BaseApi` is setup & connected)
- [x] Send Session, Fingerprint and Encryption
- [x] Make sure the client gets the right data to get to the server list screen
- [x] Zone in-to the game with a character
- [ ] Reverse all vital packets in-order to function as it was then in 2017

## How to Download
WARNING: This will only work if you have 'Z1: Battle Royale' formerly known as 'H1Z1: King of the Kill' from steam!

Use the latest version of [DepotDownloader](https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader)

Example (Downloading H1Z1: King of the Kill)
AppID : 433850  DepotID : 433851   ManifestID : 6098349229565958949

cmd : `dotnet .\DepotDownloader.dll -app 433850 -depot 433851 -manifest 6098349229565958949 -username YOURUSERNAME -password YOURPASSWORD`

## Setup ClientConfig.ini
In the H1Z1 Folder you will have a file called "ClientConfig.ini".

Remove the line ~~Server=Lvshaa-liv-l02.h1z1.net:20042;Lvshaa-liv-l02.h1z1.net:20043;Lvshaa-liv-l02.h1z1.net:20044;Lvshaa-liv-l02.h1z1.net:20045~~ 

Add the following:

- World=None
- Server=127.0.0.1:20042
- usenewui=1
- SessionId=0

At the beginning of this file.

## Building the Server
Make sure you have Visual Studio 2019 or above, installed with the C/C++ packages so you can use the 'vcvarsall.bat' file that comes with it, so you can compile/build the Login and Game server.

- Right click the 2 '.bat' files and open with 'Notepad' or any other 'Notepad' alternative i.e. 'Notepad++' and make sure the 'vcvarsall.bat' file is linked in the proper location in accordance with your Visual Studio Installation

- Double click the 'build_login_server_win_x64.bat' file to build the Login Server
- Double click the 'build_game_server_win_x64.bat' file to build the Game Server

## Launching the Server
Double click the `run_all.bat` file in the 'H1Z1-C-Server' folder to run the login-server and zone-server.
